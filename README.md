F# Sublime 
----------

A package for Sumblime 2 text editor which provides syntax highlighting and many useful snippets.

This package was (rather heavily) adapted from an old TextMate bundle (developed years ago). Unfortunately, I haven't had time to properly port some of the commands from said bundle (e.g. drag-and-drop assembly references, run selection in FSI, et cetera). In the future, I'd like to rectify this (possibly leveraging the excellent Sublime REPL package). At the very least, I'd like to hook into Sumblime's build architecture.

Please note: I've only tested this on Windows 7 and Windows 8.

Feedback and pull requests are always welcomed.
